## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Streak showing 0?
- Make sure `TEST-DATA-SIMPLE.sql` was run
- Check: `SELECT current_streak_days FROM user_activity_stats WHERE user_id IN (SELECT id FROM auth.users LIMIT 1);`

### Entertainment counts showing 0?
- Make sure you ran `QUICK-SETUP.sql` (has the new columns)
- Check: `SELECT games_played_count, videos_watched_count, songs_listened_count FROM user_activity_stats WHERE user_id IN (SELECT id FROM auth.users LIMIT 1);`

### Stats not updating after activity?
1. Check browser console for errors
2. Check Network tab for `/api/activity-stats` POST calls
3. Verify functions work: `SELECT increment_chat_session('your-user-id', 1);`
