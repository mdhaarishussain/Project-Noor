## 📊 Updated URLs After Setup

### Current Setup (HTTP Only)
```
Frontend: https://bondhu.tech ✅
Backend:  http://57.159.29.168:8000 ❌ (Spotify won't accept)
```

### After Option 1 (Ngrok)
```
Frontend: https://bondhu.tech ✅
Backend:  https://abc123.ngrok-free.app ⚠️ (Temporary, changes on restart)
```

### After Option 2 or 3 (Permanent HTTPS)
```
Frontend: https://bondhu.tech ✅
Backend:  https://api.bondhu.tech ✅ (Professional, permanent)
```

## 🛠️ What You Need to Update

After setting up HTTPS (any option), update these:

### 1. Backend .env
```bash
SPOTIFY_REDIRECT_URI=https://api.bondhu.tech/api/v1/agents/music/callback
# OR with ngrok:
SPOTIFY_REDIRECT_URI=https://abc123.ngrok-free.app/api/v1/agents/music/callback
```

### 2. Spotify Dashboard
```
Add redirect URI:
https://api.bondhu.tech/api/v1/agents/music/callback
```

### 3. Vercel Environment Variable (for permanent solutions)
```
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=https://api.bondhu.tech
```

### 4. Google OAuth (update to HTTPS too)
```
https://api.bondhu.tech/api/v1/auth/youtube/callback
```
