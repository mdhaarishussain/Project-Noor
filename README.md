# The Last Neuron - Agentic AI Companion

A personality-adaptive digital twin companion for Gen Z built with Django, leveraging reinforcement learning and NLP for dynamic personality modeling.

## 🧠 About The Last Neuron

The Last Neuron is not just a chatbot - it's an autonomous digital twin agent designed to evolve alongside its user. Built specifically for Gen Z in India, it addresses the growing mental health challenges and digital isolation through:

- **Gamified Self-Discovery**: Interactive RPG scenarios to understand personality
- **Reinforcement Learning Adaptation**: Continuously learns from user interactions
- **Mood-Aware Media Curation**: Suggests content based on real-time emotional analysis
- **Privacy-First Architecture**: Secure and anonymized user data
- **Proactive Engagement**: Initiates conversations and suggests activities

## 🏗️ Architecture

### Tech Stack
- **Backend**: Django 4.2 LTS + Django Channels + DRF
- **Real-time**: WebSockets via Django Channels + Redis
- **Database**: PostgreSQL (primary) + MongoDB (flexible schemas)
- **ML/AI**: Stable-Baselines3, scikit-learn, spaCy, Transformers
- **Frontend**: Django Templates + HTMX + Tailwind CSS
- **Tasks**: Celery + Redis
- **Security**: JWT + AES encryption + Row-level security

### Key Components
1. **Personality Engine**: Dynamic personality modeling using RL
2. **Game Engine**: RPG-style scenarios for personality assessment
3. **Chat Engine**: Real-time conversation with NLP analysis
4. **Recommendation Engine**: Mood-aware media suggestions
5. **Anti-Gaming System**: Prevents manipulation of personality model

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.9+
- PostgreSQL 15+
- Redis 6+
- Node.js (for Tailwind CSS)

### Installation

1. **Clone and setup virtual environment**
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd the-last-neuron
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

2. **Install dependencies**
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm
```

3. **Environment setup**
```bash
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your database and Redis configurations
```

4. **Database setup**
```bash
python manage.py migrate
python manage.py createsuperuser
```

5. **Run the development server**
```bash
# Terminal 1: Django server
python manage.py runserver

# Terminal 2: Celery worker
celery -A the_last_neuron worker -l info

# Terminal 3: Celery beat scheduler
celery -A the_last_neuron beat -l info
```
