# System Prompt Improvements - Multilingual & Enhanced

## Overview
Updated the personality-based system prompt generation to be more robust, multilingual, and culturally inclusive.

## Key Improvements

### 1. **Multilingual Support** ‚úÖ

**Language Detection & Mirroring:**
- AI automatically detects and responds in the user's language
- Supports English, Bengali, Hindi, and other languages
- Seamlessly switches languages if user switches
- No language mixing unless user initiates

**Friend Terminology in Multiple Languages:**
- English: "friend" or "my friend"
- Bengali: "‡¶¨‡¶®‡ßç‡¶ß‡ßÅ" (bondhu)
- Hindi: "‡§¶‡•ã‡§∏‡•ç‡§§" (dost)
- Other languages: Culturally appropriate friendly terms

**Before:**
```
- Use "‡¶¨‡¶®‡ßç‡¶ß‡ßÅ" (friend) terminology when appropriate to reinforce the friendship
```

**After:**
```

- Detect and mirror the user's language preference
- Use "friend" terminology appropriately in their language:
  * English: "friend" or "my friend"
  * Bengali: "‡¶¨‡¶®‡ßç‡¶ß‡ßÅ" (bondhu)

## Implementation Details

**File Modified:**
- `bondhu-landing/src/lib/personality-llm-context.ts`

**Function Updated:**
- `generateSystemPrompt()`

**No Backend Changes Required:**
- System prompt is generated during onboarding
- Stored in `personality_llm_context` JSONB field
- Backend uses stored prompt as-is

## Migration for Existing Users

**For users who completed onboarding before this update:**

### Option 1: Automatic (Recommended)
- Regenerate prompts on next personality assessment update
- Add "Refresh Personality Context" button in settings

### Option 2: Manual
Users can retake personality assessment to get new prompt

### Option 3: Batch Update
Run migration script to regenerate all prompts:

```typescript
// Migration script (future enhancement)
async function migrateSystemPrompts() {
  // 1. Fetch all users with personality assessments
  // 2. Regenerate LLM context using new generateLLMContext()
  // 3. Update personality_llm_context in database
}
```

## Expected User Experience

### Scenario 1: International User (English)
```
User: "Hey, I'm feeling stressed about work"
Bondhu: "Hey friend, I hear you. Work stress can be really overwhelming. 
What's been weighing on you the most?"
```

### Scenario 2: Bengali User
```
User: "‡¶Ü‡¶Æ‡¶æ‡¶∞ ‡¶Æ‡¶® ‡¶ñ‡ßÅ‡¶¨ ‡¶ñ‡¶æ‡¶∞‡¶æ‡¶™"
Bondhu: "‡¶¨‡¶®‡ßç‡¶ß‡ßÅ, ‡¶§‡ßã‡¶Æ‡¶æ‡¶∞ ‡¶ï‡¶•‡¶æ ‡¶∂‡ßÅ‡¶®‡ßá ‡¶Ü‡¶Æ‡¶ø ‡¶¨‡ßÅ‡¶ù‡¶§‡ßá ‡¶™‡¶æ‡¶∞‡¶õ‡¶ø‡•§ ‡¶ï‡ßÄ ‡¶π‡¶Ø‡¶º‡ßá‡¶õ‡ßá ‡¶¨‡¶≤‡¶¨‡ßá?"
```

### Scenario 3: Multilingual User
```
User: "Today was tough, ‡¶Ü‡¶Æ‡¶ø ‡¶ñ‡ßÅ‡¶¨ ‡¶ï‡ßç‡¶≤‡¶æ‡¶®‡ßç‡¶§"
Bondhu: "I understand, ‡¶¨‡¶®‡ßç‡¶ß‡ßÅ. It sounds like you've had an exhausting day. 
‡¶ï‡ßÄ ‡¶§‡ßã‡¶Æ‡¶æ‡¶ï‡ßá ‡¶è‡¶§ ‡¶ï‡ßç‡¶≤‡¶æ‡¶®‡ßç‡¶§ ‡¶ï‡¶∞‡ßá ‡¶¶‡¶ø‡¶Ø‡¶º‡ßá‡¶õ‡ßá?"
(Mirrors user's language mixing naturally)
```
