# Chat Context Improvements Documentation

## Overview

This document describes the improvements made to the Bondhu AI chat system to fix context loss issues and enhance overall robustness. The changes focus on properly integrating the existing conversation memory system with the LLM and adding reliability features.

## Problem Summary

The chat system was losing context during conversations because:
1. Retrieved conversation context was not being passed to the LLM
2. The `include_history` parameter in `send_message` was unused
3. No fallback mechanisms existed for system failures
4. No rate limiting or context window management was in place

## Key Improvements

### 1. Conversation Context Integration

#### Changes Made:
- **Enhanced `send_message` function** in `core/chat/gemini_service.py`:
  - Added `comprehensive_context` parameter
  - Modified function to append context to system prompt when provided
  - Updated function signature and documentation

- **Updated chat route** in `api/routes/chat.py`:
  - Modified call to `chat_service.send_message()` to include `comprehensive_context`

#### How It Works:
1. Memory retriever fetches comprehensive context including:
   - User facts from `user_memories`
   - Recent conversation summaries from `conversation_memories`
   - References to specific past conversations when detected
2. This context is passed to the LLM as part of the system prompt
3. LLM can now reference past discussions and maintain continuity

### 2. Chat History Enhancement

#### Changes Made:
- **Improved `get_chat_history` function** in `core/chat/gemini_service.py`:
  - Added `session_id` parameter for session-based filtering
  - Enhanced logging to show session information
  - Maintained chronological message ordering

- **Updated chat history usage** in `send_message`:
  - Pass session_id to `get_chat_history` for accurate context
  - Added context window limiting (last 10 messages max)

### 3. Robustness Improvements

#### Error Handling and Fallbacks:
- **Added fallback responses** when LLM fails:
  - 5 predefined empathetic fallback responses
  - Random selection to avoid repetitive responses
  - Detailed error information in response

- **Enhanced error logging**:
  - More detailed error messages
  - Better exception handling with traceback

#### Rate Limiting:
- **Implemented user-based rate limiting**:
  - 1 second minimum delay between requests per user
  - Automatic waiting when rate limit exceeded
  - Warning logs for rate limit events

#### Context Window Management:
- **Added token-aware context limiting**:
  - Maximum of 10 recent messages (5 pairs)
  - Prevents exceeding model token limits
  - Maintains conversation flow while controlling resource usage

## Files Modified

### `core/chat/gemini_service.py`
- Enhanced `send_message` function with `comprehensive_context` parameter
- Improved `get_chat_history` with session filtering
- Added rate limiting implementation
- Implemented fallback responses
- Added context window management

### `api/routes/chat.py`
- Updated call to `chat_service.send_message()` to pass comprehensive context

## Technical Details

### Function Signatures

#### Updated `send_message`:
```python
async def send_message(
    self, 
    user_id: str, 
    message: str,
    include_history: bool = False,
    session_id: Optional[str] = None,
    comprehensive_context: Optional[str] = None
) -> Dict[str, Any]:
```

#### Enhanced `get_chat_history`:
```python
async def get_chat_history(
    self, 
    user_id: str, 
    session_id: Optional[str] = None,
    limit: int = 20
) -> list[Dict[str, Any]]:
```

### Context Integration
The comprehensive context is now properly integrated into the system prompt:
```python
# Add comprehensive context if provided
if comprehensive_context:
    system_prompt = f"{system_prompt}\n\n{comprehensive_context}"
```

### Enhanced Context Handling
Conversation history is now managed more efficiently using summarization:
```python
# Include conversation history if requested
if include_history:
    chat_history = await self.get_chat_history(user_id, session_id, limit=15)
    # Use summarization for efficient context management
    summarized_context = self.summarize_conversation_context(chat_history)
    
    # Add summarized context as a system message
    if summarized_context:
        messages.append(SystemMessage(content=f"Previous conversation context:\n{summarized_context}"))
```

## Benefits

1. **Improved Context Retention**: LLM now maintains conversation history
2. **Better Session Management**: Context filtered by session when available
3. **Enhanced Reliability**: Fallback responses prevent complete failures
4. **Resource Protection**: Rate limiting and context window management
5. **Better User Experience**: More consistent and contextual responses

## Testing Recommendations

1. Verify conversation context is maintained across multiple messages
2. Test session-based context filtering
3. Validate fallback responses during LLM failures
4. Check rate limiting behavior under high load
5. Confirm context window management with long conversations

## Additional Improvements

### 1. Conversation Summarization for Long Context
For very long conversation histories, implemented summarization to maintain context without exceeding token limits:

```python
async def summarize_conversation_context(self, chat_history: list) -> str:
    """Summarize conversation history for efficient context management."""
    if not chat_history:
        return ""
    
    # For very long conversations, create a summary
    if len(chat_history) > 6:  # More than 3 message pairs
        # Extract key points from recent messages
        recent_messages = chat_history[-6:]  # Last 3 pairs
        older_messages = chat_history[:-6]
        
        # Create a brief summary of older context using the LLM
        summary_prompt = [
            SystemMessage(content="You are an AI assistant that summarizes conversations concisely."),
            HumanMessage(content=f"Summarize these previous conversation points in one short sentence: " +
                               " ".join([f"{msg['role']}: {msg['content']}" for msg in older_messages[:10]]))
        ]
        
        try:
            summary_response = await self.llm.ainvoke(summary_prompt)
            older_summary = summary_response.content[:200]  # Limit summary length
        except Exception:
            # Fallback to simple concatenation
            older_summary = "Previous conversation about " + \
                          ", ".join(set([msg['content'][:20] for msg in older_messages[:5]]))
        
        # Combine summary with recent messages
        context_parts = [f"Previous context: {older_summary}"]
        for msg in recent_messages:
            context_parts.append(f"{msg['role']}: {msg['content']}")
        
        return "\n".join(context_parts)
    else:
        # For shorter conversations, include all messages
        return "\n".join([f"{msg['role']}: {msg['content']}" for msg in chat_history])
```

### 2. Memory-Based Context Enhancement
Enhance the system prompt with user-specific memories:

```python
# Integrate with the existing memory system to include:
# - User preferences and facts
# - Important life events
# - Relationship information
# - Goals and aspirations
```

### 3. Sentiment and Mood Tracking
Enhance emotional intelligence:

```python
# Track conversation sentiment trends
# Detect emotional shifts in the dialogue
# Adapt response style based on user emotional state
```

### 4. Response Quality Assurance
Ensure consistent, high-quality responses:

```python
# Add response validation and filtering
# Implement inappropriate content detection
# Add response length and complexity controls
```

## Future Improvements

1. Add more sophisticated context relevance scoring
2. Enhance rate limiting with user-specific configurations
3. Implement more detailed analytics and monitoring
4. Add sentiment trend analysis
5. Implement adaptive response styling
6. Add content filtering and validation
