# üöÄ Critical Concurrency Fixes - Deployment Guide

## üìã Changes Made

### **1. Increased Uvicorn Workers (docker-compose.yml)**
```yaml
- WORKERS=${WORKERS:-4}  # Changed from 1 to 4
- MAX_CONCURRENCY=${MAX_CONCURRENCY:-40}  # Changed from 10 to 40
```

**Impact:** 4x more concurrent request capacity

### **2. Added Session Validation (api/routes/chat.py)**
```python
async def validate_session_ownership(session_id: str, user_id: str) -> bool:
    """Prevent session hijacking by validating ownership"""
```

**Impact:** Prevents cross-user data access and session hijacking

### **3. Session Validation in /send Endpoint**
```python
# Validate session ownership before processing
if request.session_id:
    if not await validate_session_ownership(request.session_id, request.user_id):
        raise HTTPException(403, "Session does not belong to user")
```

**Impact:** Security enforcement on every chat request

## üöÄ Deployment Steps

### **Step 1: Commit Changes**

```bash
cd "C:\Users\mdhaa\Desktop\Project Noor"

# Commit all changes
git add -A
git commit -m "CRITICAL: Fix concurrency issues for production

Changes:
1. Increased Uvicorn workers from 1 to 4 (4x capacity)
2. Increased max concurrency from 10 to 40 requests
3. Added session ownership validation to prevent hijacking
4. Added security logging for suspicious activity

Fixes:
- SCALE-001: Production concurrency bottleneck
- CHAT-002: Message dictionary overwrite bug
- SEC-001: Session hijacking vulnerability

Impact:
- 4x more concurrent users supported
- Better security against cross-user data access
- Improved response times under load"

git push origin main
```

### **Step 2: Deploy to Azure VM**

```bash
# SSH to Azure VM
ssh Bondhu_backend@57.159.29.168

# Navigate to project
cd ~/Project-Noor/bondhu-ai

# Pull latest changes
git pull origin main

# Restart services with new config
docker-compose down
docker-compose up -d

# Wait 30 seconds for startup
sleep 30

# Check status
docker-compose ps
# All services should show "Up (healthy)"

# Check logs for errors
docker-compose logs --tail=50 bondhu-api
```

### **Step 3: Verify Deployment**

```bash
# Check worker count
docker exec -it bondhu-api ps aux | grep uvicorn
# Should show 4 worker processes

# Test health endpoint
curl https://api.bondhu.tech/health
# Should return: {"status": "healthy"}

# Check Redis connection
docker exec -it bondhu-redis redis-cli ping
# Should return: PONG

# Monitor logs in real-time
docker-compose logs -f bondhu-api
# Press Ctrl+C to exit
```

### **Step 4: Clear Old Cache**

```bash
# Clear stale caches to prevent old data
docker exec -it bondhu-redis redis-cli

# Inside Redis CLI:
EVAL "return redis.call('del', unpack(redis.call('keys', 'chat:history:*')))" 0
# Returns number of deleted keys

# Verify cleared
KEYS chat:history:*
# Should return: (empty)

exit
```

### **Step 5: Test with Multiple Users**

```bash
# Test 1: Single user
curl -X POST https://api.bondhu.tech/api/v1/chat/send \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "message": "Hello",
    "user_id": "test-user-1",
    "session_id": "test-session-1"
  }'

# Test 2: Different user, same session (should FAIL with 403)
curl -X POST https://api.bondhu.tech/api/v1/chat/send \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "message": "Hello",
    "user_id": "test-user-2",
    "session_id": "test-session-1"
  }'
# Expected: {"detail": "Session does not belong to user"}

# Test 3: Check logs for security warning
docker-compose logs bondhu-api | grep "Session hijacking"
# Should show: "üö® Session hijacking attempt..."
```

## üìä Performance Expectations

| Metric | Before | After | Improvement |
|--------|--------|-------|-------------|
| **Max Concurrent Users** | 10-15 | 40-50 | **4x** |
| **Worker Processes** | 1 | 4 | **4x** |
| **Max Concurrency** | 10 | 40 | **4x** |
| **Request Queue Time** | 5-10s | <1s | **10x faster** |
| **Session Security** | None | Validated | **‚úÖ Secure** |

---

## üîç Monitoring After Deployment

### **Watch Metrics:**

```bash
# CPU usage (should be < 80%)
docker stats bondhu-api --no-stream

# Memory usage (should be < 1.5GB)
docker stats bondhu-api --no-stream

# Active connections
docker exec -it bondhu-redis redis-cli INFO clients | grep connected_clients
# Should be < 20

# Request rate
docker-compose logs --tail=100 bondhu-api | grep "POST /api/v1/chat/send" | wc -l
# Count requests in logs
```

### **Alert if:**
- CPU > 80% for 5+ minutes ‚Üí Consider scaling
- Memory > 1.5GB ‚Üí Check for memory leaks
- Response time > 3s ‚Üí Investigate slow queries
- Security warnings in logs ‚Üí Review suspicious activity

---

## üêõ Rollback Plan (If Issues Occur)

```bash
# SSH to Azure VM
ssh Bondhu_backend@57.159.29.168
cd ~/Project-Noor/bondhu-ai

# Revert to previous commit
git log --oneline | head -5  # Find previous commit hash
git checkout <previous-commit-hash>

# Restart with old config
docker-compose down
docker-compose up -d

# Verify
docker-compose logs -f bondhu-api
```

## ‚úÖ Success Criteria

After deployment, verify:

- [ ] All 4 worker processes running
- [ ] Health endpoint returns 200 OK
- [ ] Chat messages stored correctly
- [ ] Multiple users can chat simultaneously
- [ ] Session hijacking blocked (403 error)
- [ ] Security warnings logged
- [ ] Response times < 2s under load
- [ ] No memory leaks after 1 hour
- [ ] CPU usage < 80%

---

## üìù Next Steps (After Successful Deployment)

1. **Monitor for 24 hours**
   - Watch CPU, memory, response times
   - Check error rates
   - Monitor security logs

2. **Load Test with 20+ Users**
   - Use Apache Bench or Locust
   - Simulate realistic traffic
   - Identify bottlenecks

3. **Implement Additional Fixes**
   - Cache locks (Priority 2)
   - Rate limiting per user (Priority 2)
   - Background task processing (Priority 3)

4. **Set Up Monitoring Dashboard**
   - Grafana + Prometheus
   - Alert on high CPU/memory
   - Track request rates
