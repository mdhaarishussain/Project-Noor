# Mood and Sentiment Tracking - Implementation Guide

## Overview
Added automatic mood detection and sentiment scoring to all chat messages for mental health tracking and insights.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Mood Detection âœ…
Detects user's emotional state from their message using keyword analysis.

**Positive Moods:**
- `happy` - Keywords: happy, joy, excited, great, wonderful, amazing
- `grateful` - Keywords: thank, grateful, appreciate, blessed
- `calm` - Keywords: calm, peaceful, relaxed, content, serene
- `motivated` - Keywords: motivated, energized, inspired, determined

**Negative Moods:**
- `sad` - Keywords: sad, down, unhappy, depressed, blue, miserable
- `anxious` - Keywords: anxious, worried, nervous, stressed, panic, overwhelmed
- `angry` - Keywords: angry, mad, frustrated, annoyed, irritated
- `lonely` - Keywords: lonely, alone, isolated, abandoned
- `tired` - Keywords: tired, exhausted, drained, weary, fatigue

**Default:** `neutral` - When no mood keywords are detected

### 2. Sentiment Score âœ…
Numerical score from 0.0 to 1.0 indicating message sentiment:
- **0.0 - 0.3**: Negative sentiment
- **0.3 - 0.7**: Neutral sentiment  
- **0.7 - 1.0**: Positive sentiment

**Calculation:**
- Baseline: 0.5 (neutral)
- Positive keywords: +0.05 per keyword (max 1.0)
- Negative keywords: -0.05 per keyword (min 0.0)

### 3. Session Tracking âœ…
Each conversation thread gets a unique `session_id` (UUID):
- Frontend can pass existing `session_id` to continue conversation
- Backend auto-generates new `session_id` if not provided
- Enables conversation threading and analytics

## Database Schema

Messages are stored in `chat_messages` table with:
```sql
- id: uuid (primary key)
- user_id: uuid (foreign key to profiles)
- message_text: text
- sender_type: text ('user' or 'ai')
- timestamp: timestamptz (auto)
- mood_detected: text (nullable)
- sentiment_score: numeric (nullable, 0-1)
- session_id: uuid (nullable)
```

## API Usage

### Request Format:
```json
{
  "user_id": "uuid",
  "message": "I'm feeling really anxious about my exams",
  "session_id": "optional-uuid"  // Optional: pass to continue conversation
}
```

### Response Format:
```json
{
  "response": "AI response...",
  "has_personality_context": true,
  "timestamp": "2025-10-01T...",
  "message_id": "uuid"
}
```

### Database Entry (User Message):
```json
{
  "user_id": "uuid",
  "message_text": "I'm feeling really anxious about my exams",
  "sender_type": "user",
  "mood_detected": "anxious",
  "sentiment_score": 0.25,
  "session_id": "uuid",
  "timestamp": "2025-10-01T..."
}
```

## Example Detections

| User Message | Detected Mood | Sentiment Score |
|-------------|---------------|-----------------|
| "I'm so happy today!" | happy | 0.75 |
| "Feeling really stressed" | anxious | 0.25 |
| "Thanks for the help!" | grateful | 0.70 |
| "I'm exhausted and tired" | tired | 0.20 |
| "What's the weather?" | neutral | 0.50 |

## Analytics Possibilities

With this data, you can build:

### 1. Mood Timeline
Track user's emotional state over time:
```sql
SELECT 
  DATE(timestamp) as date,
  mood_detected,
  AVG(sentiment_score) as avg_sentiment,
  COUNT(*) as message_count
FROM chat_messages
WHERE user_id = 'xxx' AND sender_type = 'user'
GROUP BY DATE(timestamp), mood_detected
ORDER BY date DESC;
```

### 2. Sentiment Trends
Visualize emotional patterns:
```sql
SELECT 
  timestamp,
  sentiment_score,
  mood_detected
FROM chat_messages
WHERE user_id = 'xxx' AND sender_type = 'user'
ORDER BY timestamp DESC
LIMIT 50;
```

### 3. Conversation Analytics
Analyze session patterns:
```sql
SELECT 
  session_id,
  COUNT(*) as messages,
  MIN(timestamp) as started_at,
  MAX(timestamp) as ended_at,
  AVG(sentiment_score) as avg_sentiment
FROM chat_messages
WHERE user_id = 'xxx'
GROUP BY session_id
ORDER BY started_at DESC;
```

### 4. Mental Health Insights
Identify concerning patterns:
```sql
-- Users with consistently low sentiment
SELECT 
  user_id,
  AVG(sentiment_score) as avg_sentiment,
  COUNT(CASE WHEN mood_detected IN ('sad', 'anxious') THEN 1 END) as negative_moods
FROM chat_messages
WHERE sender_type = 'user' 
  AND timestamp > NOW() - INTERVAL '7 days'
GROUP BY user_id
HAVING AVG(sentiment_score) < 0.3;
```

## Future Enhancements

### 1. ML-Based Sentiment Analysis
Replace keyword matching with:
- BERT-based sentiment analysis
- Emotion detection models
- Context-aware mood tracking

### 2. Crisis Detection
Add automatic detection for:
- Self-harm indicators
- Suicide ideation
- Emergency situations
â†’ Trigger professional help recommendations

### 3. Personality-Aware Mood Interpretation
Adjust mood detection based on user's Big Five scores:
- High Neuroticism: More sensitive to negative keywords
- High Extraversion: Bias toward positive interpretation
- Low Agreeableness: Less emphasis on grateful/collaborative moods

### 4. Multi-Modal Analysis
Extend to:
- Voice tone analysis
- Facial expression detection (video)
- Typing pattern analysis (speed, pauses)

### 5. Intervention Triggers
Automatically suggest coping strategies when:
- Sentiment drops below threshold
- Negative moods persist across sessions
- Anxiety patterns emerge

## Testing

Test the mood detection:
```bash
# Send messages with different moods
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/v1/chat/send \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "user_id": "your-uuid",
    "message": "I'\''m feeling really anxious and stressed"
  }'
```

Check the database:
```sql
SELECT * FROM chat_messages 
WHERE user_id = 'your-uuid' 
ORDER BY timestamp DESC 
LIMIT 10;
```

## Configuration

No additional configuration needed. The mood detection is enabled by default for all messages.

To customize mood keywords, edit:
```python
# core/chat/gemini_service.py
# Method: _analyze_mood_sentiment()
```

## Performance Impact

- **Minimal**: Keyword matching is ~1ms
- **No API calls**: Local text analysis
- **Non-blocking**: Runs in parallel with Gemini

## Privacy Considerations

- Mood data is stored per-user with proper RLS
- Enable RLS policies before production
- Consider data retention policies for mental health data
- Allow users to delete mood history
