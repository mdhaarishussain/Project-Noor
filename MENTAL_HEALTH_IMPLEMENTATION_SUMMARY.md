## 🎨 Design Decisions

### Color Psychology
**Therapeutic Palette:**
- `#059669` - Green: Healing, growth, balance
- `#2563eb` - Blue: Calm, trust, serenity  
- `#7c3aed` - Purple: Peace, creativity, spirituality

**Research Basis:**
Clinical studies show blue and green reduce heart rate and promote relaxation in therapeutic settings.

### Motion Philosophy
**Gentle Over Impressive:**
- Slow, flowing movements (like breathing)
- Predictable patterns (reduce cognitive load)
- Subtle presence (support, not distract)
- Can be fully disabled (user control)

### Performance Strategy
**Efficient & Respectful:**
- Pause when not visible (Intersection Observer)
- Reduce quality on low-end devices (resolution: 0.5)
- Static fallback for reduced motion (< 1% CPU)
- Smart memory management (no leaks)

---
